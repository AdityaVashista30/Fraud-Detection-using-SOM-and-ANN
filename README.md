# Fraud-Detection-using-SOM-and-ANN
This a machine learning model using both supervised (ANN) and unsupervised (SOM) deep learning techniques to detect frauds in credit card  application dataset.

Self Organizing Maps (SOM) is used to visualize the data on a square graph, where the data are colorized from bright to dark texture. Also the points are marked with red circles and green crosses. 
Where ever there are both circle and crosses present on the same point, those points represent anomoly; hence an indicator of fraud.

In the next part and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is trained by using the above predictions and results to detect future fraud cases for new enteries.
